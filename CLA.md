# Contributor License Agreement

## Triad Orchestrator — Individual CLA v1.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Triad Orchestrator (the "Project"), maintained by NexusAI, Inc. ("NexusAI," "we," or "us"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") clarifies the intellectual property rights granted with Contributions from any person or entity.

By submitting a Contribution to the Project, you accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future Contributions.

## 1. Definitions

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by you to NexusAI for inclusion in the Project. "Submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to NexusAI or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by or on behalf of NexusAI, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by you as "Not a Contribution."

**"You"** (or "your") means the individual or legal entity making the Contribution. For legal entities, the entity making the Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered a single Contributor.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant to NexusAI and to recipients of software distributed by NexusAI a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant to NexusAI and to recipients of software distributed by NexusAI a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your Contribution with the Project to which the Contribution was submitted.

## 4. Your Representations

You represent that:

1. You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions.

2. Each of your Contributions is your original creation. You represent that your Contributions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction of which you are aware and which is associated with any part of your Contributions.

3. Your Contribution does not include any third-party copyrighted material unless clearly identified and licensed under terms compatible with this Agreement.

## 5. Support and Warranty Disclaimer

You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions, except to the extent you desire to provide support. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, you provide your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including without limitation any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 6. Contributor's Rights

This Agreement does not transfer ownership of your Contributions. You retain all right, title, and interest in your Contributions. NexusAI acknowledges that you retain a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute your Contributions in any way you see fit, including in projects that compete with the Project.

## 7. NexusAI's Rights

NexusAI is not obligated to use, include, or distribute any Contribution. NexusAI may use Contributions in any product or service, including proprietary products and services, without additional obligation to you. NexusAI may re-license the Project (including your Contributions) under different license terms for future versions.

## 8. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Oklahoma, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

## 9. Agreement

By submitting a Contribution to the Project, you acknowledge that you have read this Agreement, understand it, and agree to be bound by its terms. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements or understandings relating to Contributions to the Project.
